            "Question": "Between the SST-2 and PubMed datasets, which dataset shows a larger discrepancy in accuracy between its classes, and by how much?",
            "Answer": "PubMed with a difference of 1%.",
            "Explanation": "The SST-2 dataset’s Positive and Negative classes have the same accuracy (98%), so the discrepancy is 98%−98%=0%. PubMed Objective has 98% accuracy, and PubMed Conclusion has 99% accuracy, with a discrepancy of 99%−98%=1%. The SST-2 dataset shows no discrepancy, while PubMed shows a 1% discrepancy, so PubMed has the larger discrepancy."
